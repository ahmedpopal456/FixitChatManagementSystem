# Introduction 
This repository contains:
1. The internal lib used by the Fixit service to allow for backend chat operations, including basic CRUD for creating conversations, persisting messages, etc. 
3. The CI/CD terraform-based files, and Azure yaml, allowing the deployment of this service
4. The RestAPI interface (deployed in a multi-tenant fashion), allowing for the client application to get relevant data
5. The event-driven Azure trigger functions' project, handling any relevant message on listened topics
